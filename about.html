        <h3>Natural Born Hacker</h3>
        <p><span class="lead-text">My life has been an ongoing quest</span> to find a career that merges my passions, skills and interests.  Starting at a very young age I was completely taken by gadgets and staying up on the latest technology. At the age of 11 I was begging my family for a Gateway 2000 Pentium 90. I remember the day I ripped open that cow printed box so I could experience first-hand the fastest processor of the time. Soon after, we were the first family on the block with DSL (how I convinced my cable TV free family of that one I'll never know) and I was impressing my friends with mix CDs I had burned with songs I had downloaded off of Napster. I upgraded to an HP tower computer and would geek out by swapping out video cards, adding RAM, and reading up on the newest Sound Blasters Creative Labs had on the market.<br/><br/> Naturally, I wanted to pursue a career in computer science, and even transferred high schools so I could take AP Computer Science. While learning C/C++ was exciting and came very naturally when I looked around the computer lab I was the only girl and didn’t get MIT or Carnegie Mellon level grades. It was the late 90s/early 00s, so I believed a career in tech wasn’t in the cards, chalked it all up to an expensive hobby and started to explore other paths...</p>
        <h3>Art Direction: All the Pretty Things</h3>
        <p>In college I majored in Advertising and Visual Communications. Among several things, this taught me the importance of understanding a target market to create an effective message, developed my love for typography, and gave me the misfortune of learning how to slice up Photoshop mockups to import into Fireworks and Dreamweaver to create a “stunning website.” Is Adobe Flash still a thing for animations? Yes, I can do that too. I’m pretty old school.</p>
        <h3>Waiting Tables &amp; Bartending: Serving Empathy</h3>
        <p>To make a living while in portfolio school, I waited tables and bartended at an Italian restaurant in the River North neighborhood of Chicago. Honestly, I loved working in the service industry and was pretty damn good at it. The best part of this job was creating really great dining experiences for my guests by understanding who they were and what they were looking for. You have but a few moments to get the information you need to make that happen, and you must be able to do this repeatedly each night juggling multiple groups and needs at the same time. The two keys to success here: empathy and prioritization. Also, a pair of really comfortable shoes.</p>
        <h3>Law School: A 3 Year Logic and Analysis Boot Camp</h3>
        <p>After a few years, it was time to hang up my apron. As much as I loved the flexibility of waiting tables, I knew it wasn’t going to be a sustainable solution for me in the long term. I had an itch for a new analytical challenge, and I longed for a career of “helping people.” I grew up with in a Filipino family of doctors, so there was a lot of pressure to “figure it out” and go to professional school. I had long told them anything medical related was not in the card for me, so I believed my best alternative was going to law school. Afterall, much of my angsty teen years was marked by my mother telling me I argued “like a lawyer.”</p>
